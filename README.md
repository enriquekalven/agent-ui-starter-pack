# Agent UI Starter Pack: Production-Ready Agent Ops

The world's first **Agent Ops Platform** for Google Cloud. Moving beyond "Hello World" to cost-optimized, security-hardened, and production-ready agent infrastructure.

## 🚀 Why This Starter Pack?

Most agent templates give you a chat window and leave you to figure out the rest. We focus on **Day 2 Operations**: Optimization, Cost Control, and Infrastructure. 

*   **Vercel for GCP Agents:** 1-click deployment to Cloud Run with automatic scaling to zero.
*   **The Optimizer:** Built-in CLI and CI/CD for prompt compression, context caching, and smart model routing. Supports interactive `approve/reject` workflows.
*   **Cost Guardrails:** Python middleware for budget management and turn-based token usage auditing.
*   **Production Stack:** Vertex AI (Gemini 2.0), Cloud Run, Firestore, and Google Cloud Trace out of the box.

## 🏗️ The Production Stack (The Google Cloud Agent Stack)

| Feature | Standard "Starter Pack" | **Agent UI Production Pack** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hosting** | Localhost / Vercel | **Cloud Run (Sidecar)** |
| **Model** | OpenAI Wrapper | **Vertex AI (Gemini 2.0)** |
| **Memory** | In-memory array | **Firestore / AlloyDB** |
| **Caching** | None | **Gemini Context Caching** |
| **Ops** | `print()` statements | **Google Cloud Trace** |

## Usage

You can use the CLI directly without installation using `uvx`.

```bash
# General Command Structure
uvx agentui-starter-pack create <project-name> [OPTIONS]
```

## Quick Start

Select the implementation standard that matches your tech stack:

### A2UI Standard (React + Vite)
The default template, optimized for performance and zero-dependency rendering.
```bash
uvx agentui-starter-pack create my-ui
```

### AG UI (High-Fidelity React)
Uses the **AG UI** standard (CopilotKit) for high-end React implementations with streaming pipes.
```bash
uvx agentui-starter-pack create my-ui --ui agui
```

### GenUI SDK (Flutter)
Scaffolds the project with the **GenUI SDK bridge**, ideal for cross-platform mobile and web apps.
```bash
uvx agentui-starter-pack create my-ui --ui flutter
```

### Web Components (Lit)
Standardized Web Components that can be embedded into any framework (Angular, Vue, etc).
```bash
uvx agentui-starter-pack create my-ui --ui lit
```

## 🔍 The Optimizer (Interactive Agent Ops)

Ensuring your agent is cost-efficient is critical for production. The `optimizer.py` CLI audits your agent code and proposes optimizations that you can interactively approve or reject.

```bash
# Run the audit
make audit
```

**What it checks:**
1.  **Context Caching**: Identifies large static prompts and suggests Gemini Context Caching.
2.  **Prompt Compression**: Finds redundant tokens in your A2UI blueprints.
3.  **Model Routing**: Audits routing logic to ensure Gemini 2.0 Flash is used for simple tasks.

**Workflow:**
The CLI will show a diff of the proposed change and ask:
`Do you want to apply this optimization? (approve/reject) [approve]:`

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **Python**: v3.10 or higher (for the CLI)
- **Git**: Installed and configured

## 🏗️ The Agentic Ecosystem

Agent UI Starter Pack is more than just a renderer—it is the bridge between the logic-heavy world of Agent Frameworks and the visual world of Modern Frontend.

### The Agentic Stack
![Agentic Stack](/diagrams/agentic-stack.png)

A2UI sits as the critical middleware layer:
1.  **Agent Brain**: Frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, or Google ADK reason and plan.
2.  **A2UI Gateway**: The agent outputs a structured JSON Blueprint instead of raw text.
3.  **A2UI Renderer**: This starter pack interprets the blueprint and manifests a high-fidelity React interface in real-time.

### Value Proposition: From Text to Interface
![Value Proposition](/diagrams/value-proposition.png)

*   **Move Beyond Chat**: Don't trap your users in a chat bubble. Provide full application surfaces that adapt to the agent's current task.
*   **Standardized Schema**: Use the Google-originated A2UI standard to ensure your UI is portable across Web, Mobile (Flutter), and Desktop.
*   **Production Ready**: Built-in support for Multi-Agent orchestration, human-in-the-loop approvals, and complex data visualization.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Standards

- **A2UI**: The core protocol for adaptive, JSON-driven interfaces. [Official Repo](https://github.com/google/A2UI)
- **GenUI (Generative UI)**: Full support for generative patterns across Web and Flutter.
- **AG UI (Agentic UI)**: Integration-ready for [CopilotKit](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit) and high-end React surfaces.
- **Lit Web Components**: Standards-based components for any framework.

### Standard Comparison

| Standard | Role | Core Value |

## 🚀 Deployment

One-liner deployment commands are provided via the included `Makefile`.

| Platform | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Run** | `make deploy-cloud-run` |
| **Firebase** | `make deploy-firebase` |

## 📡 Protocol Standards

### A2A Protocol
The **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocol enables agents to communicate over a network. See the [A2A_GUIDE.md](./A2A_GUIDE.md) for multi-agent orchestration.

### A2UI Schema
The renderer expects an `A2UISurface` object:

```json
{
  "surfaceId": "unique-id",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "Text",
      "props": { "text": "Hello World", "variant": "h1" }
    },
    {
      "type": "Card",
      "props": { "title": "System Meta" },
      "children": []
    }
  ]
}
```
